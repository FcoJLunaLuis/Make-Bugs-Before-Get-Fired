This is a compilation of words that will be used as a tutorial to teach you to play my game
13 People take little time to judge but a long time to correct themselves
13 The closer you get to the light the bigger your shadow will be
9 Dont mistake my silence for a lack of mourning
6 Leaders and heroes dont choose themselves
7 Cry your way Ill do it mine
7 dont depend on anyone in this world
9 Even your own shadow leaves you in the dark
8 It is incredible what a person can forget
10 but it is more surprising what they come to hide
4 Just letting strangers in
8 we can find new ways to be ourselves
5 The heart can be weak
6 But sometimes its all we need
7 The right man in the wrong place
7 can change the course of the world
9 We dont choose how we start in this life
10 True greatness is what we do with what we have
11 In the end we only regret what we have not done
6 Hope is what makes us strong
8 It is the reason why we are here
10 Its what we fight for when all else is lost
